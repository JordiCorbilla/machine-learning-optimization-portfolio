# Portfolio Optimization with Machine Learning and Mean-Variance Analysis

This project demonstrates how to optimize a portfolio using a combination of **Machine Learning** and **Mean-Variance Optimization**. By leveraging predictive modeling and statistical methods, the project aims to achieve better **risk-adjusted returns** through dynamic portfolio allocation strategies.

---

## **Features**
- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Uses **Mean-Variance Optimization** to identify efficient asset allocation.
  - Incorporates **machine learning models** (e.g., Linear Regression) for return predictions.

- **Black-Litterman Framework**:
  - Adjusts market returns with investor views to refine expected returns.

- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Benchmarks portfolios against the S&P 500.
  - Provides key performance metrics: **Sharpe Ratio**, **Sortino Ratio**, and **Information Ratio**.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plots **Efficient Frontier**, **Capital Market Line**, and portfolio performance.
  - Displays key statistics in tabular format alongside visual insights.
